## Live Demo

You can check out the live demo [here](https://macroix.netlify.app).

## Overview

**Macroix** is a dynamic, interactive calorie display app designed to make comparing food and recipes easier and more intuitive than existing apps like MyFitnessPal. It offers a more user-friendly interface and enhanced features for tracking and managing your nutritional intake.

- **Add Foods to Recipes**: Use the plus sign on the right side of each food item in the `Food list` table to add foods to your current recipe effortlessly.
- **Recipe Management**: Right-click on a recipe tab to access a menu with options for renaming, deleting, and duplicating recipes.
- **Multiple Recipe Management**: Create and manage multiple recipes, switching between them seamlessly to compare their calorie and macronutrient content.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The panel on the right dynamically updates to reflect the nutritional differences between your selected recipes.

## Known Bugs

- **Recipe Deletion**: Ensure that at least one recipe remains in the app; deleting all recipes may cause issues.

## Notes

- **Local Storage**: Macroix functions entirely using your browser's local storage, so your data is saved locally on your device.
- **Technology Stack**: This project is built using **React** for the user interface, **Vite** as the build tool for fast and optimized development, and **Material UI** for sleek, responsive components.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes are currently used but may be removed in the future to streamline the workflow. **Styled Components** are also used for more customized, component-specific styling.

## Status

This project is currently a work in progress and in a very early stage of development. The code will be shared once it's more mature.
